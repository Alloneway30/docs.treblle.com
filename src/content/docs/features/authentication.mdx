With Treblle, we offer authentication features like Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Social Sign-On to secure your workspace effectively.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications or systems without needing to authenticate repeatedly.

### Setting Up SSO

1. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**
   - As a workspace owner, go to your workspace settings and locate the **Authentication** section.

2. **Choose Your Authentication Type**
   - Select between SAML or OpenID Connect based on your identity provider. Consult your IT admin or provider documentation if needed.

     - Identity Provider Certificate (IdP)

### SSO Flow Across Workspaces

Once SSO is enabled, users can log in using their organization's identity provider. If a user switches between an SSO-protected workspace and a standard workspace, Treblle will prompt for extra authentication to maintain security.

### Social Sign-On for Flexibility

For teams or contractors, Social Sign-On offers a fast and convenient way to access workspaces by linking Google or GitHub accounts.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring two or more verification steps during login. Typically, it combines something you know (like a password) and something you have (like a mobile app code).

### Enabling MFA

1. **Go to Account Settings**
   - Locate the **Multi-Factor Authentication** option.

3. **Scan and Verify**
   - Use an authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator) to scan the QR code. 
   - Verify your MFA setup by entering the code from the app.

## Social Sign-On

Social Sign-On lets users log in with existing accounts such as Google or GitHub.
This feature is particularly useful for teams that prefer using familiar credentials instead of creating new ones.
