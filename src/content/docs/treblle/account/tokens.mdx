## Personal Access Tokens

In order to utilize the Treblle platform API, users need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT).

The PAT can be created by going into your Personal Account Settings (identity.treblle.com), selecting the `Developer Settings` tab, and generating a token.

Users can name their token, select which app they will use the token with, and choose an expiration period.

For security purposes, we do recommend regenerating your token at least every 90 days.
