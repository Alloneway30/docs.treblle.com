## Account Settings

User Account Settings are accessible on identity.treblle.com. Here you can update your profile image and personal information such as name, username, and email. You can also access other Treblle applications.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

In addition to username/password, Treblle allows users to add an extra layer of security with multi-factor authentication.

Once enabled, users will be required to enter the one-time pass code every time they login.

## Theme and Timezone

Users can also select their preferred Theme (light/dark mode) and Timezone. These serve as the default selection for each Treblle app, but can be changed temporarily within each app itself.

## Delete Account

Users can permanently delete their Treblle account.

Before deleting your account, users should ensure that any team Workspace, where they are a Workspace Owner, has the `Owner` role transferred to another member or that another Workspace Owner already exists in that Workspace. \
Once you select Delete, you will need to confirm this action.
