2. **Scan QR Code**
   
   Use an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator) to scan the provided QR code.

   Input the 6-digit code from your authenticator app to verify the setup.

4. **Complete Setup**
   
   Click **Verify MFA** to enable multi-factor authentication on your account.

### Using MFA

Once enabled, you'll need to provide a one-time secret from your authenticator app every time you log in, significantly improving your account security.

### Managing MFA

- **Re-enable MFA**: Follow the setup process again to re-activate MFA
