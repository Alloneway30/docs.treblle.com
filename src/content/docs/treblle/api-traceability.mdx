API traceability in Treblle helps you monitor and track API request and response data across all your APIs.

Only workspace owners can access this feature.

### Using Trace IDs

To enable traceability, include a custom header called `treblle-tag-id`. This trace ID allows tracking of requests across all APIs registered with Treblle.

### Best Practices

- Use a unique prefix: Format your trace ID as `treblle-identity-123123123` to indicate its origin within Treblle.

- Ensure uniqueness: Append a unique identifier such as a hash, ULID, or any suitable format for your system.
