API traceability in Treblle helps you monitor the request and response of API calls across all your APIs.

To optimize this feature, use a custom header called treblle-tag-id. This trace ID will trace the request across any APIs you have registered with Treblle.

A best practice is to prefix this trace ID header with something unique to you, like: treblle-identity-123123123, indicating the trace originated from the Treblle organization, on the Identity service. The random letters or numbers after can be a hash, ULID, or anything fitting your scenario.
