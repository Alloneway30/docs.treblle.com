## What is Alfred?

Alfred is Treblleâ€™s AI assistant that helps improve your API workflows. It uses your API documentation to provide real-time answers.

**Security Note:** Alfred accesses only your API documentation and does not store or analyze your data. It helps you by improving your documentation and integration process based on your current API setup.

## Prerequisites

- [Treblle](https://identity.treblle.com/login) account.
- API created in Treblle.
- [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) or [Treblle SDK](https://docs.treblle.com/integrations/) integration.

## Steps to Get Started with Alfred

You can use Alfred in several ways:

- By Integrating with Treblle SDK.
- By uploading your OpenAPI Specfication.
- Within your Developer Portal.

### **By Integrating with Treblle SDK**

Integrating the Treblle SDK will automatically generate API docs and a developer portal with Alfred.

You can find integration guides for various languages and platforms [here](https://www.treblle.com/integrations/).

#### Step 1: Access Alfred

- Go to the API Docs section of your Treblle workspace.

- Look for Alfred in the bottom right corner of the screen.

  />

#### Step 2: Interact with Alfred

    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

- Ask questions or request assistance with your API documentation, such as identifying issues, generating code examples, or improving endpoint documentation.

#### Example:

  width="300"
  style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
/>

### **By uploading your OpenAPI Specfication.**

If you are not integrating the Treblle SDK, you can upload your [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) (version 3 or above) directly to Treblle.

**Note:** You will need to update the specification manually whenever changes are made to keep Alfred's information up to date.

#### Step 1: Access OpenAPI Specfication

- Go to the API Setting section of your Treblle workspace.

    width="200"
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

  #### Step 2: Upload OpenAPI Specfication

- Click on upload to add your OpenAPI Specfication.

    style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />

### Within your Developer Portal

To embed Alfred into your developer portal, follow these steps:

1. Add the following script to your portal:

Insert the HTML snippet to embed Alfred:

```html
<script src="https://assets.treblle.com/alfred-embed-v5.min.js"></script>
```

Place the script before your portal's `</body>` tag to ensure smooth page rendering.

```javascript
<div
  class="getalfred-io"
  data-api="_YOUR_TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID_"
  data-auth="_YOUR_CUSTOMER_API_KEY_"
></div>
```

Replace _YOUR_TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID_ with your API ID and _YOUR_CUSTOMER_API_KEY_ with your SDK TOKEN. This enables Alfred to append your customer's details into the integration process.
