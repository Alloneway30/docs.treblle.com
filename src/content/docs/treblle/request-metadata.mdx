Request metadata is a feature in Treblle that permits the addition of custom data to requests. This functionality enhances API observability, facilitating the understanding and debugging of issues.

Custom request metadata can be added by setting custom headers onto the request, such as TREBLLE_USER_ID. This approach allows flexibility in filtering specific request attributes that may not be suitable as query parameters or request inputs.

For instance, when fetching a list of products without returning a user object within the request/response payload, but still needing to associate that request with a particular user, any value can be returned under `treblle-user-id`. This value could be a UUID, email, name, or other identifier. It can then be filtered and searched within the Treblle project's dashboard.

Moreover, by leveraging this feature, developers can gain more precise insights into how individual users are interacting with their APIs. This level of granularity can be especially valuable in tracking down specific issues or patterns that might affect subsets of users or particular user journeys. By filtering logs and metrics based on the custom request metadata, teams can efficiently troubleshoot and optimize their API performance.

In addition, custom request metadata facilitates enhanced security and compliance tracking. By associating specific user actions with unique identifiers, it is possible to audit access and interactions systematically. This is crucial for industries that operate under stringent regulatory requirements, ensuring that all user activities are transparently recorded.

Furthermore, integrating custom request metadata provides a comprehensive approach to personalized analytics. By analyzing metrics tied to individual user identifiers, you can tailor their offerings, improve user experiences, and drive engagement. This data-driven customization allows for more informed decision-making and targeted improvements across your API ecosystem.
