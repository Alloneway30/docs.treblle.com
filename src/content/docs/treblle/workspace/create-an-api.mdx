APIs are the backbone of modern software and ensuring that you have high quality APIs is what Treblle does best. To add your API, click `Add New API` in the left navigation sidebar and fill out the required fields.

API Name - a name that your team or company understands as this particular API

Base URL - root address of your API

Environment - describes the stage that the API exists in (i.e., Staging, Production, Development)

Platform - language or framework that your API is built in (e.g., Laravel, Node, .Net).

Visibility - option determines if API is *private* or *public*. A *private* API is viewable only to API Owners and Members. A *public* API is displayed in the Workspace API List for all Workspace Members.

## Integrate SDK

Next, you can integrate our SDK into your app.

List of / links to SDKs docs

Integrating an SDK will bring your API Data into Treblle, which you can then dive deeper into using the capabilities of the platform. 

To learn more, see How Treblle SDK Works.

## Upload OpenAPI Specification

Instead of (or in addition to) integrating an SDK, users can upload an existing OpenAPI 3.x specification. 

This can be done by going into the API Settings in the left sidebar.

Once on the Settings screen, users will see an option to Upload an OpenAPI Specification.

OpenAPI files can be in JSON or YAML formats.

Once successfully uploaded, users will see a success message in the bottom right.

## Data Sources and Trebble Capabilities

Users with only an OpenAPI file uploaded (no SDK), will get valuable information about their API, such as Governance and Documentation. However, with only the OpenAPI spec, users will not get request level data including Security, Compliance, Problems, etc.

Users can choose to upload their OpenAPI specification alongside the SDK, which will provide a more complete overview of their API. For example, with SDK and OpenAPI Specification, users will get Governance and API Scoring analysis from both sources. This provides the most accurate view into an API, as it accounts for design and implementation. 

Please read through documentation for each individual capability to see how data sources are used.
