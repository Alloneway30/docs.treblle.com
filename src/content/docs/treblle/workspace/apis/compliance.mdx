Our compliance solution analyzes every request and flags any protected or sensitive data in that request that falls under GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS that has not been masked. We then show you a calendar or graphical view of requests that appear to contain sensitive data.

While authenticated requests often return protected or sensitive data by design, our compliance solution helps users quickly trace and remediate scenarios where data has been exposed or when data breaches have occurred. It is also a tool that developers can use to monitor request compliance for new version or newly launched APIs.

## Compliance Feature

By going into Compliance, users see a graphical or calendar based design, where they can select dates and see a list of requests that contain sensitive data from one of the frameworks below.

Once a request has been identified, users can dive into the request and see all the information Treblle provides, including the full request response and information about the end user. See Requests.

Based on this analysis, users can determine if further research is needed or if a plan around communication, mitigation, and remediation needs to be created.
