## Workspace Dashboard

The Workspace Dashboard is similar to a Home Screen. It provides high level information about your APIs as well as the tools to navigate into specific APIs.

## API Landscape Analytics

At the top of the Workspace Dashboard, users are shown three high level datasets that provide an overview of all APIs that you have access to.

If you are a Workspace Member, you will see the Total number of “public” APIs as well as APIs that you are a Member or Owner of. See People & Workspace Roles and Visibility.

**Total Requests** - this is the number of requests for all APIs included in your Total APIs.

**Issues** - We calculate this value every 5 minutes based on data points used in our proprietary Heartbeat model. This model provides a comprehensive view into how the APIs you have access to are doing.

When a Workspace has a lot of APIs, discoverability becomes a challenge. Treblle helps make it easy for users and teams to find what they're looking for by offering multiple ways to search, filter, "publish," and make their APIs easily discoverable.

## API List

The first place a user might search for an API is on the Workspace API List.

Below the API Landscape Analytics on the Workspace Dashboard is a list of all the APIs that you have access to including all APIs that have been marked as \`Public\`. See Visibility.

## Finding APIs

When a team has several hundred or thousands of APIs, we provide several ways for users to search or find APIs that they are interested in.

## Favorites

Users can Favorite an API by clicking on the star on the right side of the row. Users can then show only the list of APIs that have been selected as favorites by choosing the Favorite toggle on the upper right of the API List.

## Filtering

Users can narrow the number of APIs by filtering the list by SDK and/or Environment.

## Search

Users can find APIs by using our free text search.

## Timescale

And lastly, users can narrow a search based on a timescale of when APIs were created.

## Catalog

Enterprise customers often have a larger number of roles who need access to API documentation. These can be technical and non-technical users, who may not be in the engineering organization or have any contact with specific API development teams. They may also not care about API operational data or care about the API's quality, security, etc. 

The Catalog is a way for API teams to provide users with a more curated discoverability experience.
