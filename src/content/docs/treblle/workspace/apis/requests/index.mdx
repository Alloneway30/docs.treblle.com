Requests are calls to your API Endpoints and are the core transaction that APIs are built for.

You can see API requests across all your API endpoints by selecting **Requests** in the left navigation sidebar.

## Individual Request Data

As we mentioned, the core transaction of APIs are requests. This means when analyzing an API, users need to understand what is happening at the request level. Treblle has a great deal of data about each individual request at user's fingertips. 

**Request Replay** - this includes the API request and response payloads: Headers, Body, Auth, etc.
