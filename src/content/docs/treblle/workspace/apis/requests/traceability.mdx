Traceability is a feature that allows users to see an originating request, when an API is called from another request.

## Configuring SDK

To utilize this feature, users must add a custom header called <span style="color: rgb(235, 87, 87)">treblle-trace-id</span>. This ID will track or trace the request across any APIs you have registered.

A best practice is to prefix this trace ID header with something unique to you, like: organizationName-serviceName-123123123, indicating the trace originated from `organization name`, on the `serviceName` with hash, ULID, or any other identifier (in this example it is `123123123`) fitting your scenario.

## Viewing Traced Requests

To view Traced Requests, users can go into a Request and click on Metadata. If the current Request originates from another request that is tracked, it will be shown here. 

Users can then click into the originating request and get all the Request details.
