Every API has two options for Documentation.

1\. Treblle can auto-generate API documentation with OpenAPI 3.x Specification support.

2\. Users can Upload their own OpenAPI 3.x Specification in JSON or YAML format that will be converted to a Docs friendly page.

Uploading API Specifications

To upload your OpenAPI 3.xx Specification (JSON or YAML) file, users must go to the API Settings screen and scroll down to the OpenAPI Specification box. 

While Treblle can auto-generate API Specifications, a manually uploaded Specification file is the default file used for API Documentation. Treblleâ€™s auto-generated spec will not be used or shown.

Resources

Users can add documents, images, and other files as additional resources in the API Documentation. This allows for even greater context for API consumers and can serve as a source of truth for API Developers.
