The Problems page displays a list of both codebase and non-codebase errors by Endpoint.

Users have a high level view of all Problems compared to total Requests. Users can then dive into each Endpoint to see a list of the pertinent requests.

Treblle can check misspellings that might cause problems in your API[ documentation](https://docs.treblle.com/treblle/api-documentation/).\
We also detect when something is not normal with a request: such as a non-2xx response, high load time, etc.

Users can see a list of problems, find other related problems, and dive into the request for more information.
