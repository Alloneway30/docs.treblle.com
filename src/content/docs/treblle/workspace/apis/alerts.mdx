Treblle provides alerts to users based on specific criteria. Alerts are important because they send users a signal that something is wrong or needs to be checked.

In order to keep Alert noise at a minimum, users must created an Alert based on a Saved Search. This ensure that there is no noise on what the user wants to be alerted about. 

## Setting up Alert

Go to My Alert Settings on the API navigation sidebar and select `My Alert Settings`.
