## List of Widgets

Widgets can be broken into two broad categories. User- or API Consumer-centric Widgets and API-centric Widgets. Each Widget is meant to ask answer specific questions that an API stakeholder might want to know about their APIs.

## **User-Centric Widgets**

These Widgets are meant to answer questions about where your users are coming from? How are they distributed across the globe or a geographic area? What devices, operating systems, browsers, and app versions are my users leveraging when using my API? Should we optimize our APIs or API infrastructure to make the user experience better based on this data?

**Top countries**

**Requests map**

**Top devices**

**Client App versions**

## **API-Focused Widgets**

These Widgets are meant to answer questions about the API specifically. Is this API active? Are recent requests returning the expected response? Is my API performant? Do recent requests have a security threat that should be investigated? There are many more questions that our Widgets will help you answer without even diving deeper into Treblle data.
