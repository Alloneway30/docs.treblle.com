## API Dashboard 

The API Dashboard contains a high level view into the API. 

Depending on your role, you may be interested in several different types of information about your APIs. You might also have specific questions about your APIs that need answered on a regular interval.

The data from Widgets largely come from API Requests, which are the core transaction APIs are built for. Our Widgets answer basic questions such as were recent requests successful, performant, and secure? But go deeper and provide a data about your API users and usage that are more business-focused.
