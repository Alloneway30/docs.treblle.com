## API Details

API ID - This is the API identifier used alongside your Treblle API Token to integrate our SDKs. This ensures the SDK knows what API within Treblle to send the data to.

Treble API Token - This is the API Owner's Personal Access Token (PAT) that is needed to integrate the SDK. This token authorizes data to be sent to the API, identified by the API ID above. This token cannot be used to gain access to a specific user account and is not associated with user account information.

API Details - This is basic information and details about your API.

Make this API Private (see API Visibility) - While Workspace Owners will be able to see your API regardless of visibility setting, selecting this will hide your API from the Workspace API List for Workspace Members (excluding current members of the API).

## Uploading API Specifications

OpenAPI Specification - This allows you to upload an OpenAPI Specification file (JSON or YAML), which will allow you to utilize several features of Treblle when you do not have a functioning API developed.

## Share

Share - This allows an API Owner to enable or disable creation and sharing of expired links for API elements.

## People

People - Similar to Inviting Users to the Workspace, users can be invited to join the API.

- **Owner** - An API Owner can manage all API Settings. There can be multiple Owners in an API.

- **Member** - An API Member will have full access to the API screens, but will have limited abilities to change or manage API settings.

## People

API Members are managed in API People List. Roles can be changed and people can be removed from the API.

Publishing to the Catalog will allow users additional ways to find the API, by curating it by Category, Tags, and by robust searchable descriptions. See Catalog.

Leave - Allows users to leave the API. API Ownership will be transfered to another member if the last Owner leaves the API. 

Delete - Allows API Owners the ability to Delete the API. Deleting an API means you'll lose all the data about your API: docs, endpoints, requests, analytics and everything in between. We don't keep backups of your deleted APIs.
