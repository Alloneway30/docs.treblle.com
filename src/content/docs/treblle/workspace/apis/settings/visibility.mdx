The API Visibility setting determines whether the API will appear on the API Landscape List for all Workspace members in the Workspace Dashboard. 

An API Owner can do this when creating an API, or if an API already exists, the API Owner can click into API Settings on the left sidebar and go to the API Details section. Here, they will see a check-box to `Make this API Private`.

## Making API Private

Making the API Private adds another layer of security, particularly when you do not want an API publicized to Workspace members. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the API being used on a confidential project or because the API is still in early development.

Treblle sets APIs to Private by default.

## Making API Public

Making the API Public will cause it to appear on the API Landscape list in the teamâ€™s Workspace Dashboard. This means that all Workspace owners and members will see the API. 

This setting can be used as a way to promote discovery, but more importantly as a way for API leaders to ensure that there is governance, quality, and consistency across their entire API landscape. Leaders can quickly see on which APIs they should dedicated more time or resources, or identify which APIs are meeting the standard that others should meet. For Workspace Members, this provides a way to more easily compare your APIs with peer groups.
