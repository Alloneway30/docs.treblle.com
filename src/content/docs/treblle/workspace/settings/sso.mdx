Treblle allows Enterprise teams to require users to log in with Single Sign-On via their Identity Provider (IdP). To configure this, a Workspace Owner must go into Settings on the left sidebar, then select Authentication and Configure SSO.

Treblle currently supports SAML 2.0 or openIDC for SSO.

Once the SSO standard Type is selected, the user must input the required fields, including the Identity Provider (IdP) Certificate

User accounts will match on `email` only, so this means that user emails must be the same in Treblle as they are in the IdP. See Sign-in & Account Settings.

Important Note: A Workspace Owner must remove a user from the Treblle Workspace People list to completely remove access to the Workspace. See People & Workspace Roles
