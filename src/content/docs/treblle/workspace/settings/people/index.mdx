## People List

Members of the Workspace can be managed by going into Workspace Settings and using the Workspace People list.

The People List contains all current members of the Workspace, their email, username, first/last name, and Workspace role.

Workspace Owners can manage members by changing Workspace Roles as well as deleting users from the Workspace.
