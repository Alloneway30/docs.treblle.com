## Workspace Roles

Each user invited to a Workspace is given a Workspace role. This is for security reasons and to ensure management, settings, and configuration of the Workspace is limited.

**Workspace Owner** - A Workspace Owner can manage all People, Settings, and configurations in the Workspace. There can be multiple Owners in a Workspace, but there must be at least one Owner.

If there is only a single Workspace Owner who attempts to leave a Workspace, they will be prompted to transfer ownership to another member.

**Workspace Member** - A Workspace Member will have limited access to Workspace settings. They will not be able to send invites or manage users.
