## Aspen Collections

   - Aspen's Collections feature allows you to organize your API requests into groups for easy management and reuse.

   - You can create folders and sub-folders within Collections to organize your requests by API flow, service, or other criteria.
   
   <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 800px;">
    <iframe 
     src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ut0lI2Euxt8" 
     style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border-radius: 8px;"
     frameborder="0"
     allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
   </div>

     #### Create a Collection

      From the History sidebar, save your API requests as a Collection and name them according to your needs.

        width="800"
        style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
      />

     #### Search Through Collections
