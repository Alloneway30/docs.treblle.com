## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- MuleSoft API Gateway 4+
- Java 17 or higher
- Anypoint Studio 7.21.0 or later
- An active MuleSoft account with API Manager access
- Maven 3.8+ configured with proper `settings.xml`
- A [Treblle account](https://identity.treblle.com/) with API key and SDK token

## Creating and Deploying the Custom Policy

This guide will walk you through creating, configuring, and deploying a custom Mule 4 policy that sends incoming request payloads and headers to Treblle when a request is received.

### Obtaining Organization ID

1. Navigate to [Anypoint Platform Business Groups](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/businessGroups)
2. Select your business group
3. Note the **Business Group ID** from the URL or page details. You'll need this for the next step.

:::note
The Business Group ID is a unique identifier that looks like: `68ef933a-6a4e-4d9d-8262-9c2a93c11111`
:::

### Updating Policy Configuration

1. Clone the Treblle MuleSoft repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Treblle/treblle-mulesoft.git
   cd treblle-mulesoft
   ```

2. Open `treblle-policy/pom.xml` and update the `groupId` with your Business Group ID:

   ```xml
   <groupId>{BUSINESS_GROUP_ID}</groupId>
   ```

### Configuring Maven Settings

1. Navigate to the `samples/.m2/settings.xml` file
2. Update your MuleSoft credentials:

   ```xml
   <username>{YOUR_MULESOFT_USERNAME}</username>
   <password>{YOUR_MULESOFT_PASSWORD}</password>
   ```

:::caution
Ensure your MuleSoft account has sufficient permissions to deploy to Exchange. You may need the Exchange Contributor or Exchange Administrator role.
:::

### Building and Deploying the Policy

1. Navigate to the `treblle-policy` directory:

   ```bash
   cd treblle-policy
   ```

2. Build the policy:

   ```bash
   mvn -s ../samples/.m2/settings.xml clean package
   ```

3. Deploy to MuleSoft Exchange:

   ```bash
   mvn -s ../samples/.m2/settings.xml clean deploy
   ```

:::tip
If you encounter permission errors during deployment, verify that your MuleSoft account has the necessary API Manager and Exchange permissions.
:::

### Verifying Policy Installation

1. Visit [Anypoint Exchange](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange)
2. Search for "treblle policy"
3. Confirm the policy is available in your organization

The policy should appear with version 1.0.0 and display as a Custom Policy.

## Applying the Treblle Policy to Your API

### Configuring API Manager

1. Log in to [Anypoint Platform](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/)
2. Navigate to **API Manager**
3. Select your API (e.g., `hello-world`)
4. Go to the **Policies** tab
5. Click **Apply New Policy**

:::note
Ensure your API is already deployed and running in CloudHub or Runtime Manager before applying the policy.
:::

### Configuring Treblle Policy

1. Choose **treblle-policy** from the list of available policies
2. Configure the policy with your Treblle credentials:
   - **API Key**: Enter your Treblle API key
   - **SDK Token**: Enter your Treblle SDK token

### Applying and Testing

1. Save the policy configuration
2. Apply the policy to your API
3. Invoke your API endpoint with a test request
4. Check your [Treblle Dashboard](https://treblle.com/) to see the API traffic

The request should appear in Treblle within a few seconds, including headers, payload, and response data.


## How It Works

The Treblle MuleSoft policy acts as a middleware that:

1. Intercepts incoming API requests before they reach your implementation
2. Captures request payloads and headers without modifying them
3. Sends the data asynchronously to Treblle's servers
4. Allows the request to continue to your API implementation without delay
